# tinyRSA
TinyRSA is a web app written in Python to show how the RSA cryptosystem works with all size of keys.
The goal is to allow people who want to learn about RSA to experiment with small keys and see the algorithm running.  
Its purpose is educational. For more information on RSA read the wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29).
