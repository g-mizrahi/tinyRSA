# tinyRSA
TinyRSA is a web app written in Python to show how the RSA cryptosystem works with all size of keys. It is hosted on Heroku [here](https://tinyrsa.herokuapp.com/).  
The goal is to allow people who want to learn about RSA to experiment with small keys and see the algorithm running.  
Its purpose is educational. For more information on RSA read the wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29).

## TO DO
### Backend
1. Implement security checks, fail gracefully
2. Better encoding, padding etc of text before encryption
3. Better decoding of data after decryption
### Frontend
1. Better looking page : minimalist design
2. Better display of keys and text
3. Possibility to select the value of the bit length of keys
4. Better explanation of process
